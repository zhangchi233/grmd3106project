a tool use dkjsktra algorithm on qgis for network analysis and routes planning
remeber to set the path of base map: the road nets on script
to simplify, i just set the pedstrain nets and driving nets as the same vector files(hhhhh, just because i am so lazy) if you want to distinguish walking-biking mode and driving mode, you can just substitude and insert your own networks map's path on script
for simplication, the output is pre-detemined, you can change it
